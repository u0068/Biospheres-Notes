Notes: 
- `1 Frieza (Fr) = 1 microsecond per cell per tick`
# Design Requirements
## Simulation
- [ ] Stability
	- [ ] Deterministic
	- [ ] Energy constant or lost
	- [ ] Angular and linear momentum is conserved
- [ ] Performance:
	- [ ] [[GPU Simulation]]: 
		- [ ] Real time performance for huge cell count
        - [ ] Variable speed controls, no backwards simulation
			- [ ] Target: `100K cells at >50tps = <0.2Fr
		- [ ] Same result as CPU and Preview simulations
        - [ ] Fluid and Gas simulation
	- [ ] [[CPU Simulation]]:
		- [ ] Very fast performance for medium cell count
        - [ ] Manual time scrubber control only, no automatic linear progression
			- [ ] Target: `10K cells at >50tps = <2Fr
	- [ ] [[Preview Simulation]]:
		- [ ] Smaller, faster version of [[CPU Simulation]].
		- [ ] Real time update on genome change
			- [ ] CPU Sim target: `2Fr = Simulating 256 cells for 30 ticks in 16ms`
		 - [ ] Using a different number of threads to CPU sim to optimize for low cell count
		 - [ ] Controlled by scrubber
	 - [ ] Optimizations:
		 - [ ] Framerate limit, so we don't render more frames than we can display
		 - [ ] Data oriented design, SoA
		 - [ ] Opengl DSA
		 - [ ] Spatial partitioning
			 - [ ] Grid is easier to implement, but if the world is much bigger than the number of cells then it might be better to use octrees
		 - [ ] Backface culling
		 - [ ] Frustum culling
		 - [ ] Leverage bevy's renderer for CPU sim
- [ ] Cell physics properties
	- [ ] I'm considering determining cell orientations based on their relative position to genome instead of doing true angular physics, but I'm unsure how well that would work
- [ ] Cell collisions:
	- [ ] Cells have soft collisions with each other and the world boundary
	- [ ] Force is proportional to overlap between cells and the cells' cytoskeleton gene
	- [ ] Optimization: 
		- [ ] Use spatial partitioning to minimize required number of checks
- [ ] Cell division:
	- [ ] **DETERMINISTIC ALLOCATION!!!**
		- [ ] Prefix-sum and scatter is a theoretically sound allocator for gpu
		- [ ] For CPU sim, a single threaded compaction is probably good enough
	- [ ] When the cell is ready to divide (correct split mass/time, cell and adhesion limits not hit) it will divide into 2 daughter cells according to genome.
- [ ] Cell adhesion:
	- [ ] Inheritance
		- [ ] Genome defined, not spatial
	- [ ] Physics
		- [ ] Linear springs
		- [ ] Angular springs?
		- [ ] Alternatively, linear spring to a target position to fake lever forces
		- [ ] Angular constraints (preferably 'hard stop')
		- [ ] Break after max force (to avoid trying to compute high forces that cause instability)
- [ ] Cell types:
	- [ ] Chronocyte
		- [ ] Splits after a set time
	- [ ] Phagocyte
		- [ ] Eats food to gain biomass
	- [ ] Photocyte
		- [ ] Absorbs light to gain biomass
	- [ ] Flagellocyte
		- [ ] Propels itself forward
	- [ ] All the cell lab cells + our own inventions 
- [ ] Cell signaling
	- [ ] 4 Signaling substances like in cell lab (or maybe more if we want)
- [ ] Cell behavior
	- [ ] Cells can change their behavior based on various stimuli, like in cell lab 
- [ ] Genomes:
	- [ ] Many modes
		- [ ] Fixed or dynamic number of modes?
			- [ ] Dynamic seems more user friendly but might be less performant, but we would need to measure its performance impact to determine how significant it is
			- [ ] Could be dynamic up to a set limit for memory 
			- [ ] The issue with dynamic is that the computer can't trivially calculate the position in memory that each genome is stored at
			- [ ] This may be an issue for gpu especially
