## Design requirements:
- Space engineers-like 6DOF camera movement. 
	- WASD for moving through the world
	- Mouse look
	- QE Roll
### Nice to have:
- Blender/unity-like orbital camera option
	- Orbit with mouse look
	- Panning
	- Zoom with mouse wheel
	- Can be merged with Space-engineers-like camera (0 orbit distance)
- Sprint

### Properties
- Location
	- Position
	- Orientation
	- Orbit distance
- Controls
	- Keybinds
	- Mouse sensitivity
	- Movement speed
	- Sprint speed
	- Roll speed
	- Zoom speed
